# pymagicstrip

## Purpose

Minimal python library for controlling LED controllers that use the MagicStrip iOS/Android app. These are inexpensive, white labeled controllers that are available on Amazon, AliExpress, etc. under brand names that include TOPMAX and L8star.

The firmware on these devices is terrible so feature support is spotty.

## Device Support

This library only supports RGB LED strips that appear in the MagicStrip app under the name "HTZM". RGBW, RGBWW, etc. devices are not currently supported.

## Use

This library is based on the python [bleak](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak) library and does not abstract/wrap all features. You must use bleak directly alongside pymagicstrip.

For usage examples, see https://github.com/elahd/ha-magicstrip. (Apologies for the lack of clear examples here.)
